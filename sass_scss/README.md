SASS & SCSS PROJECT:

Welcome to the Sass & SCSS project! This repository is designed to help us learn and master Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) and SCSS (Sassy CSS), two powerful tools for writing CSS more efficiently.

ABOUT SASS & SCSS:

Sass is a CSS preprocessor that adds features to CSS such as:

* Variables
* Nesting
* Partials and imports
* Mixins
* Inheritance

SCSS is the newer syntax of Sass, which is fully compatible with CSS, making it easier to integrate into existing projects.
