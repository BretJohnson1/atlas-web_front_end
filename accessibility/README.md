Accessibility

This project aims to enhance the accessibility of webpages by ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can easily navigate and interact with web content. By following WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), this project helps ensure that websites are inclusive, functional, and compliant with industry standards.

Key Features

Provides support for keyboard navigation and screen readers.

Ensures compatibility with assistive technologies.
Adheres to WCAG 2.1 guidelines at Level AA and Level AAA.

Includes features such as captions for video content, skip navigation links, semantic HTML, and ARIA roles.

The main objective of this project is to:

1. Improve web accessibility for users with different disabilities, including visual, auditory, cognitive, and motor impairments.

2. Ensure websites meet accessibility standards like WCAG, focusing on Level AA as a baseline for compliance.

3. Develop reusable components that assist developers in building accessible web interfaces.

The project includes several tools and best practices to help developers implement accessibility features. Key areas of focus include:

Descriptive Link Text: Ensure that all link text is descriptive and not ambiguous (e.g., avoid "click here").

Keyboard Accessibility: Provide clear and logical keyboard navigation across interactive elements.
Captions for Videos: Ensure that all video content includes captions for both pre-recorded and live content.

Text Alternatives for Images: Provide alt text for all images to describe their function or content.

Skip Navigation Links: Allow users to skip repetitive content, such as navigation menus, and jump directly to the main content.

Color Contrast: Ensure that the color contrast between text and background meets WCAG standards (minimum of 4.5:1 for normal text).

ARIA Roles: Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles, properties, and states where necessary to enhance accessibility for screen reader users.

WCAG Compliance

This project strives to meet the following WCAG 2.1 compliance levels:

Level A: Basic web accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation, text alternatives).

Level AA: More advanced accessibility measures (e.g., color contrast, descriptive link text).

Level AAA: The highest level of accessibility (e.g., enhanced navigation options, detailed explanations for unusual terms).
